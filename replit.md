# CAP Squadron Inventory System

## Overview

This is a Civil Air Patrol (CAP) Squadron Inventory Management System designed as a web-based application for tracking and managing squadron equipment and resources. The system appears to be in early development with a focus on creating a professional, military-themed user interface that aligns with CAP branding standards.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Bootstrap 5.3.0 framework
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap for responsive design and components
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.0.0 for iconography
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CAP-branded color scheme and modern design patterns
- **Design Pattern**: Single-page application structure with component-based styling

### Backend Architecture
- **Current State**: Frontend-only implementation
- **Expected Evolution**: Will likely require a backend API for data management, user authentication, and inventory operations

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Current State**: No database implementation present
- **Future Requirements**: Will need persistent storage for inventory items, user accounts, squadron data, and transaction history

## Key Components

### Visual Design System
- **Color Palette**: CAP-branded colors including navy blue (#003366), gold (#FFD700), and light blue (#4A90E2)
- **Typography**: Segoe UI font family for modern, readable interface
- **Card-based Layout**: Hover effects and smooth transitions for interactive elements
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Bootstrap grid system

### User Interface Elements
- **Navigation**: Dark-themed navbar with CAP branding
- **Cards**: Modern card-based components with hover animations
- **Interactive Effects**: CSS transforms and transitions for enhanced user experience

## Data Flow

### Current Implementation
- Static HTML structure with no dynamic data flow
- CSS-only interactions and visual feedback

### Expected Data Flow
1. **User Authentication**: Login/logout with role-based access control
2. **Inventory Management**: CRUD operations for equipment items
3. **Check-in/Check-out**: Transaction tracking for equipment usage
4. **Reporting**: Generate reports on inventory status and usage patterns

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: UI framework and components
- **Font Awesome 6.0.0**: Icon library for visual elements

### Future Dependencies
- Backend framework (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Database system for persistent storage
- Authentication service
- Potential integration with CAP systems or external inventory management tools

## Deployment Strategy

### Current State
- Static file deployment suitable for any web server
- No build process or compilation required

### Future Deployment Considerations
- Will require server infrastructure for backend services
- Database hosting and management
- Environment configuration for development, staging, and production
- Potential containerization for consistent deployment across environments

### Security Considerations
- Implementation of secure authentication mechanisms
- Role-based access control for different user types
- Data encryption for sensitive squadron information
- Audit logging for inventory transactions

## Development Roadmap

### Immediate Needs
1. Complete the HTML structure for all planned features
2. Implement JavaScript functionality for dynamic interactions
3. Design database schema for inventory and user management
4. Develop backend API endpoints

### Long-term Goals
1. User authentication and authorization system
2. Complete inventory management functionality
3. Reporting and analytics capabilities
4. Integration with existing CAP systems if applicable
